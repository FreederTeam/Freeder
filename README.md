Freeder
=======

Freeder is a new open-source RSS feeds reader, as announced [here](http://phyks.me/2014/07/lecteur_rss_ideal.html).


Disclaimer
----------

It is currently a WIP, more information will come soon. In the mean time, it may be only interesting for devs.

_Note :_ There are some TODOs in the files. If you are a developper and want to give a hand, this is what you should look for :)

Installation
------------

### Dependencies

 * `php5-sqlite`
 * `php5-curl`

Coding guidelines
-----------------

Just look at the actual files, and try to reproduce it (or propose to update it to enhance coding guidelines :).

Please avoid commits with large number of modifications due to spaces to tabs conversions and stuff like this, as their diff is really unreadable.
