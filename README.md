## License

All the source code I wrote is under a `no-alcohol beer-ware license`. All functions that I didn't write myself are under the original license and their origin is specified in the function itself.
```

* "THE NO-ALCOHOL BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):
* Phyks (webmaster@phyks.me) wrote this file. As long as you retain this notice you
* can do whatever you want with this stuff (and you can also do whatever you want
* with this stuff without retaining it, but that's not cool...). If we meet some
* day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a <del>beer</del> soda
* in return.
